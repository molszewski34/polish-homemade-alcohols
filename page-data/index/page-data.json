When you read wikipedia about this plant you get information about usage in chinesse desserts and flower jams. As it is rugosa rose is very fine to make it and i saw people gathering her fruits just to have something special which you cannot find in markets. I would personally never bothered to make even single jar of it. Why? Because one jams are made for sandwitches, some for cakes and some are so aromatic you can't eat them in big portions. If i would use some rugosa rose jam i would probably use it for polish donuts as filling or add gelatine and make a cookies with filling on top, but as i make donuts once per year and cookies are also not something i eat every month i decided to make some wine of it. As you read further you will probably start to understand my decision.\n\nTo be honest. I would probably never found this wine if didn't live near the sea. Rugosa roses are invasive species and grows without any complication near roads, beaches and meadows. I don't know how much of it grow in other regions of poland but here you can find it almost everywhere. So when you have so many fruits why don't use it for wine.\n\n## Picking fruits\n\nFruits are ready to pick near september or even october. Ideal moment is when they are between being tender and soft. They must be tender to pick them and soft to pour more juice during fermentation. I always want more juice. With juice comes more flavor. Harvesting is easier as gathering wild rose _(Rosa canina)_ but still hard enough to be annoying. Every branch has countless thorns so the only good way for me is pick them touching lower part of fruit and pull. Sometimes fruit likes to lose small portion of lower part. Second annoying thing is consistence of fruit. They are like wet flower compacted in mass and have small fibers. That is why next time i gonna use some gloves for protection. After 45 min, me and my brother gathered 5 kg which is not good, not terrible.\n\n![IMG_20220923_180349(1).jpg](https://media.graphassets.com/R2Qzc8fQhaoVwKG78bEk \"IMG_20220923_180349(1).jpg\")\n\nStrainer is full of small particles and need to be clean and sanitize after every filtration.\n\n## Preparing fruits\n\nThere are 2 ways of preparing. One way is slow and used in making jams and second is used to prepare wine. The best way to clean fruits is by using water. Take a bucket with lid or any hermetic container, pour water, add fruits, close the lid and then shake it until most of seeds are out. Then take a sieve and gather all the seads from surface. You can also skip this step if you want your wine a bit bitter.\n\n## Preparing a batch\n\n**10l of wine**\n\n**3kg of prepared rugosa rose fruits (5 kg of unprepared)**\n\n**9l of water**\n\n**2.6kg of sugar**\n\n**3g wine nutrient**\n\n_**saccharomyces cerevisiae**_**yeasts 16%**\n\nTools: rubber hose, blg meter, strainer - bigger the better, second bucket min. 12l  \n\n\nProcess is very simple. Put fruits in jar, pour hot water with mixed sugar. Water must be boiled before you add. It will prevent bacterial infection and mxing sugar is easier in hot water. Prepare yeasts. Yeasts must be added below 30 deg or they gonna die. When you finish adding all ingridients you can add 3g of nutrients. After that batch must be check with Blg meter. It is simple device to check level of sugar in water. Batch should have around 30-32 blg and ferment to 16% alcohol.\n\nFermentation is quick a last around 1 to max 2 weeks. When Blg is 0 move fruits out of batch. Then wait around 1-2 hours for batch to calm down. During this time most of \"orange particles\" move down and you can start first filtration. This wine need to be filter atleast few times and during first filtration you will need to use a strainer and ruber hose. Most of leftovers should be at the bottom of container but in this wine particles are in whole wine so be prepared and filter from the start. There is so many particles in upper level you will need to use measuring cup. I used 500 ml cup. Just take sanitized cup and pour it into strainer until bucket is empty. It can take atleast half hour.

After 45 min, me and my brother gathered 5 kg which is not good, not terrible.

One way is slow and used in making jams and second is used to prepare wine. The best way to clean fruits is by using water. Take a bucket with lid or any hermetic container, pour water, add fruits, close the lid and then shake it until most of seeds are out. Then take a sieve and gather all the seads from surface. You can also skip this step if you want your wine a bit bitter.

Put fruits in jar, pour hot water with mixed sugar. Water must be boiled before you add. It will prevent bacterial infection and mxing sugar is easier in hot water. Prepare yeasts. Yeasts must be added below 30 deg or they gonna die. When you finish adding all ingridients you can add 3g of nutrients. After that batch must be check with Blg meter.

When Blg is 0 move fruits out of batch. Then wait around 1-2 hours for batch to calm down. During this time most of \"orange particles\" move down and you can start first filtration. This wine need to be filter atleast few times and during first filtration you will need to use a strainer and ruber hose. Most of leftovers should be at the bottom of container but in this wine particles are in whole wine so be prepared and filter from the start. There is so many particles in upper level you will need to use measuring cup. I used 500 ml cup. Just take sanitized cup and pour it into strainer until bucket is empty. It can take atleast half hour. After that you can add more sugar for flavor.

most important thing in making ciders is to make a good juice as base for fermentation. If Good cider should be sour, sweet and a bit bitter. That said, it is imposible to make it from only one type of apple. That is why you mix them. In place where i live most of apples are mostly sour and bitter so i have this luck i already get 2 flavors of 3. So how to get last? You can buy fruits from internet which i do not recommend for price you gonna pay. In my case i get 50 kg of apples my neighbor grow near house. Most of those apple would go for marmalade or waste so i get them almost free of charge. Rest of apple - 20l i get as already made juice from market. It is a good deal. Even if somehow you get apples from some grower for 1zł per kg which is the best price you can get, you still gonna get 70% of juice and you get 5l for 7zł and you don't have to move through whole process.\n\n### Few words about juice for fermentation\n\nFirst of all it doesn't matter how sweet is juice before fermentation. After fermentation, product is without sugar so sweetness of apple determinate only how much alcohol you have in batch. I made batch of sour and grape fruits with addition of juice from sweet apples and only result was highter concentration of alcohol. So if you want less sour cider better chosse less sour apples than try to corect it with another. Another type of apples give you additional flavor or tannins and that is all.\n\n### Preparing batch\n\n#### 25l of cider\n\n**25l of apple juice**\n\n**cider yeasts for one batch**\n\n**3g of nutrition**\n\nCider is one of the easiest wine to make and also easiest to fail. When you have 3-4% alcohol it is easy to get infection. So when you prepare a batch you must be sure everything is sanitize. I go into sanitation so far i even purify juice. In typical wines you don't need to that because 13% alcohol and yeasts can kill bacteria without problem, but when level of alcohol is so low you need to be sure there is no bacteria at the start. Ofcourse many people want to avoid any sulfation because they want their batch out of \"chemicals\" but they also risk infection and you infection point where you just pour you \"healthy\" batch into closet with all the money you put into. Speaking about \"chemical\" _potassium metabisulfite_is added in portion 1g per 10l of batch and then evaporates after 24 hours. After 24 hours you can add yeasts and whole process is out of risk.\n\nFirst of all you need to prepare juice and there is a way i consider the most efficient and some people are amazed how much juice you can get this way. You can also make it of juice bought from market or internet, but diffrence is from which apples that juice is which often is not even described and miniatures like to show apples which look good for consumer. So back to making juice. You need atleast few things before you even start making juice. The rule is \"the more you pay, less time you spend on making it\". If you use juicer you saved a lot of time but also wasted apple skin which is another flavor. If you want that flavor you need to use something to grind your apples. Meat grinder is fine when you make small batch of 10l or even 20l, but in big batches above 30l i would consider atleast special cutting tip for drill and fruit press.\n\n**Method i describe now is for batches above 30l.**Cut apples in quaters. You don't even need to remove seeds. Just cut them in quaters and push into some big plastic container. After this you need to grind apples. Some people use self designed grinder but i didn't want to build one so it will take place in garage for 1 action per year. Instead of it i use cutting tip for drill. Process looks like mixing cement but this way i can grind 10kg of apples in 2 minutes. When i am done i put all grinded apples into fermenter and add hot almost boiling water. Apples in hot water takes more juice and thin the juice. On top of that i add Pectoenzyme - liquid which amplifies it even more. Then i wait 24 hours and use a fruit press. Important thing in using press is to use it again after first squeezing. In second squeezing you can get another few liters of juice. Rest of method is described below.\n\n![IMG_20220906_130751 (1)(1).jpg](https://media.graphassets.com/output=format:webp/resize=width:2336,height:4160/Hp77gAu9R6Wpal49djc6 \"IMG_20220906_130751 (1)(1).jpg\")\n\n**Method for small batches**. Use juicer. If you realy want juice from all of those apples you can use fruit press, but in small batches it is not worth the price. Gathered juice pour into fermenter and add _potassium metabisulfite._Let it rest for next 24 hours or even 48 to evaporate. Add yeast and nutrition. Fermentation last 2 weeks and after that i filter and wait another week. After this cider is done and you can do refermentation.\n\n_**Refermentation is easy to make, but must be made carefully. Cider with to much dose of sugar in bottle can explode and send sharp fragments of glass making damage to walls or body. To avoid it always use maximum 6g of sugar per liter.**_\n\nBoil 500 ml of water and pour amount of sugar per liter. When boiled add it into fermentor with faucet. Reason behind it is you want to avoid oxygenation. It is the same thing with beer. More oxygen you add before pouring cider into bottles, faster it get older and this can affect the taste.\n\nThen you use a hose and pour cider on top of sugar syrup. Pour the cider as slow as you can to avoid oxygenation.\n\n### Why using fruits instead of already prepared juice is better\n\nThe main reason is taste. This year during summer season i made experiment with apple nectar from company \"Riviva\". I made a small batch of 10l. Only thing i needed to do was prepare fermenter add nectar, yeasts, nutrients and done. Result was fine. After all sugar was eaten by yeast what remained was a bit sour cider with some grape flavor and i could also feel addition of some flavors they add for consumers. It was fine cider. Until now i have 2 last bottles to make comparision. You can make fine cider from those drinks but they lack few things. First is tannin. It is an important ingriedient in white wines and determinate after-taste of wine. To get it you need to ferment fruits with their skins and many of made off juices i know are made almost the same way i do in big batches but apples are macerate for only 90 min where juice for wines is macerate for 24 hours. During this time apples relase most of tannins and add characteristic for wines after-taste.\n\nOk. I hope i added something new to common knowledge about ciders and this wall of text gonna help someone. Many of details are self thought and checked season after season with better results so this is probably not last post about ciders. If you, dear Reader have any question you can always ask by email.\n","text":"The most important thing in making ciders is to make a good juice as base for fermentation.

Most of those apple would go for marmalade or waste so i get them almost free of charge. Rest of apple - 20l i get as already made juice from market. It is a good deal. Even if somehow you get apples from some grower for 1zł per kg which is the best price you can get, you still gonna get 70% of juice and you get 5l for 7zł and you don't have to move through whole process.\\nFew words about juice for fermentation\\nFirst of all it doesn't matter how sweet is juice before fermentation. After fermentation, product is without sugar so sweetness of apple determinate only how much alcohol you have in batch. I made batch of sour and grape fruits with addition of juice from sweet apples and only result was highter concentration of alcohol. So if you want less sour cider better chosse less sour apples than try to corect it with another. Another type of apples give you additional flavor or tannins and that is all. \\nPreparing batch\\n25l of cider \\n25l of apple juice\\ncider yeasts for one batch\\n3g of nutrition\\nCider is one of the easiest wine to make and also easiest to fail. When you have 3-4% alcohol it is easy to get infection. So when you prepare a batch you must be sure everything is sanitize. I go into sanitation so far i even purify juice. In typical wines you don't need to that because 13% alcohol and yeasts can kill bacteria without problem, but when level of alcohol is so low you need to be sure there is no bacteria at the start. Ofcourse many people want to avoid any sulfation because they want their batch out of \"chemicals\" but they also risk infection and you infection point where you just pour you \"healthy\" batch into closet with all the money you put into.  Speaking about \"chemical\" \\npotassium metabisulfite \\nis added in portion 1g per 10l of batch and then evaporates after 24 hours. After 24 hours you can add yeasts and whole process is out of risk.\\nFirst of all you need to prepare juice and there is a way i consider the most efficient and some people are amazed how much juice you can get this way. You can also make it of juice bought from market or internet, but diffrence is from which apples that juice is which often is not even described and miniatures like to show apples which look good for consumer. So back to making juice. You need atleast few things before you even start making juice. The rule is \"the more you pay, less time you spend on making it\". If you use juicer you saved a lot of time but also wasted apple skin which is another flavor. If you want that flavor you need to use something to grind your apples. Meat grinder is fine when you make small batch of 10l or even 20l, but in big batches above 30l i would consider atleast special cutting tip for drill and fruit press. \\nMethod i describe now is for batches above 30l.  \\nCut apples in quaters. You don't even need to remove seeds. Just cut them in quaters and push into some big plastic container. After this you need to grind apples. Some people use self designed grinder but i didn't want to build one so it will take place in garage for 1 action per year. Instead of it i use cutting tip for drill. Process looks like mixing cement but this way i can grind 10kg of apples in 2 minutes. When i am done i put all grinded apples into fermenter and add hot almost boiling water. Apples in hot water takes more juice and thin the juice. On top of that i add Pectoenzyme - liquid which amplifies it even more. Then i wait 24 hours and use a fruit press. Important thing in using press is to use it again after first squeezing. In second squeezing you can get another few liters of juice. Rest of method is described below.\\n\\nMethod for small batches \\n. Use juicer. If you realy want juice from all of those apples you can use fruit press, but in small batches it is not worth the price. Gathered juice pour into fermenter and add \\npotassium metabisulfite. \\nLet it rest for next 24 hours or even 48 to evaporate. Add yeast and nutrition. Fermentation last 2 weeks and after that i filter and wait another week. After this cider is done and you can do refermentation. \\nRefermentation is easy to make, but must be made carefully. Cider with to much dose of sugar in bottle can explode and send sharp fragments of glass making damage to walls or body. To avoid it always use maximum 6g of sugar per liter.\\nBoil 500 ml of water and pour amount of sugar per liter. When boiled add it into fermentor with faucet. Reason behind it is you want to avoid oxygenation. It is the same thing with beer. More oxygen you add  before pouring cider into bottles, faster it get older and this can affect the taste. \\nThen you use a hose and pour cider on top of sugar syrup. Pour the cider as slow as you can to avoid oxygenation. \\nWhy using fruits instead of already prepared juice is better\\nThe main reason is taste. This year during summer season i made experiment with apple nectar from company \"Riviva\". I made a small batch of 10l. Only thing i needed to do was prepare fermenter add nectar, yeasts, nutrients and done. Result was fine. After all sugar was eaten by yeast what remained was a bit sour cider with some grape flavor and i could also feel addition of some flavors they add for consumers. It was fine cider. Until now i have 2 last bottles to make comparision. You can make fine cider from those drinks but they lack few things. First is tannin. It is an important ingriedient in white wines and determinate after-taste of wine. To get it you need to ferment fruits with their skins and many of made off juices i know are made almost the same way i do in big batches but apples are macerate for only 90 min where juice for wines is macerate for 24 hours. During this time apples relase most of tannins and add characteristic for wines after-taste.\\nOk. I hope i added something new to common knowledge about ciders and this wall of text gonna help someone.
