The main reason is a structure of fruit. Berry of sea buckthorn is almost completly fill with juice, so every atempt can end with squizing the juice and waste it in result. At the top of that every little branch has thorns so picking it without plan is a good way to waste a day and pick only half of what you tried to get.\n\nLuckly people found better way to pick sea buckthorn. You pick small branches with fruits and freeze them for few hours until they are are rock solid. Normaly you would also want to freeze fruits before puting them into jar because fruits need to be frozen anyway. This way fruits loose strange taste and become lightly sour and sweet.
