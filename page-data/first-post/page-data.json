Poland is in central Europe close to Russia so we probably do moonshine. Yes we brew moonshine to some degree, but we also makes a lot of other things most of people never heard off. \\nOne of examples are tinctures. There are 2 types of them: medicinal and flavored. To be honest i am not fan of medicial ones. Most of them just not taste good. Are they healthy? I don't know. Market of pseudo healthy products which gives you better immunity against disease or enchance organ functions is worth bilions, but it often comes from unqualified persons and yes they help, but in most cases you can skip using them and don't feel any diffrence. Maybe in future i will post some article about making one, but i want to focus on flavored ones, because they are ones you get when you come to some regional harvest festival. In most cases what you will get is tincture from cherry, plums, bird cherry, quince, walnut, strawberry, black lilac and more. Most of them is made from fruits typical for region. On example you will not see so often sea buckthorn tincture in center of poland. \\nThis type of regional alcohols gonna be main focus of blog.
